- Complex problem involves a number of different layers and impacts a wide range of people, and the more you learn about the problem, the more people it seems to affect. For example: climate change. It involves countries, workers, baby born post 2021, economic, future, …
- Solving a complex problem requires deeper understanding of the actual problem and all of the people it affects. Complex problem solving involves gathering observations and asked questions to make informed decisions, considering how future developments could affect a potential solution’s continued success, and understanding how the solution will affect both the people involved and the surrounding environment.

# Step 1: clearly define the problem (scope and impact)

- You must clearly and objectively define what the problem is: what is the root cause of the problem, and what are each of its contributing factors? Who does the problem affect, and how does it affect them: physically, emotionally, financially and spiritually? Does the problem affect their safety?

# Step 2: push the limits of your assumptions (resources)

- It’s important to bring as many different perspectives to the table as possible to limit any potential biases. Collaborate with a team of different minds from different backgrounds and with different skill sets to gather as many ideas as you can.
- Focus on quantity because you need the bot so good ideas to find the good one. Don’t focus on what’s possible at this stage. Don’t limit yourself to your assumptions or what you believe to be possible

# Step 3: test assumptions and gather feedback (solution)
- Do research and gather feedback and test your assumptions around the problem space.
- Research and gather feedback is not a one time thing. It’s a process which will take time and many trips out into the community. Each potential solution will need to be tested thoroughly and shared with the people it will affect

# Step 4: seek continuous improvement (implement and prepare for changes)
- Each solution you find will need to be tested and adapted to reveal new insights that you can put into practice next time
